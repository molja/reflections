git log - to view all history commits. And to return to the previos commits if you know their title.
git clon - to clone repository. Difference between copy that is git clone copies all line of commits.
git checkout - to check commit which you will choose.
git status - check info about existence of produced commits.
git init - to create new repository.
git add - to add files to the stagiing area (area between working directory and repository)
git log --graph --oneline master coins easy-mode - (master, coins, easy-mode names of branches). 
show you history list of branches which you reminded.
git branch -d coins - delete label
git show (id commit)- difference between current commit and his last parent
git merge master coins -(master, coins- names of branches.) to merge branches.



















How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers????
