git log - to view all history commits. And to return to the previos commits if you know their title.
git clon - to clone repository. Difference between copy that is git clone copies all line of commits.
git checkout - to check commit which you will choose.
git status - check info about existence of produced commits.
git init - to create new repository.
git add - to add files to the stagiing area (area between working directory and repository)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers????
